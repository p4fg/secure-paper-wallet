Secure Paper Wallet
JavaScript Client-Side Bitcoin Wallet Printer

Background
----------------
My requirements on a paper wallet for long-term storage of bitcoins are:

1) Possible to print on a full page (A4 or letter)
2) Private keys on the printout should be redundant in several formats
3) Private keys on the printout should be large enough so that any fading of ink/toner does not matter.
4) Have direct links to several block-explorers to validate the balance
5) Must be able to run and print from a totally non-networked computer using a modern browser
6) Must allow me to generate a private key externally from a trusted source

There exists several nice paper-wallet generators online today, but most of them are focused
on providing a grapically beautiful paper-wallet. In my opinion they do not prioritize long-time security as the
sensitive information is printed too small to safeguard against fading, water-damage etc.

The site www.bitaddress.org were the closest match but required generation of secure random seeds and lots of 
navigation before getting to printing a wallet.

This project
----------------
I choose to base my work on bitaddress.org but with a few tweaks:

1) Everything except the printing of a paper-wallet is removed, it cannot generate wallets.
2) Starts immediately at the page where wallets are printed
3) Larger sizes for important information (such as the private key QR-code and hex)
4) Armory-style printing of hexcode with spaces to make manual re-entry easier
5) Second page with "public" information such as the public address and links to block-explorers
   that can be put on the outside of the envelope holding the wallet.
6) Re-styled using bootstrap and jquery
7) Mostly tested in Chrome (Verified working in IE11)

The wallets created by this software are intended to be printed on a full-sized page (A4/Letter) and be
put in an envelope inside a safety-deposit box or safe. No fancy folding or holographic stickers are required.

Safety notes
----------------
1) Generate your private keys however you like, preferrably using a non-networked computer
2) Use this on a non-networked computer, printing with a printer you trust
3) Use high quality acid-free paper (ISO 9706/ISO 11108) and good quality toner/ink
